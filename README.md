# POC22. 

I tried to add a cross button along with the user text input that removes all the text the user has typed in. 
I successfully align the button and edittext view horizontally back to back, but the major issue is somehow the program does not run.
There are other problems such as that the button is not shaped as a cross and that the button click does not change the text at all.

Ultimately my work was not successful. It's a fairly simple compound custom control but I don't think I understand how edittext view works.
So, I have to look deeper into that view class and how changing text works.
